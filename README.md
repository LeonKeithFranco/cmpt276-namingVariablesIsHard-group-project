Proposal:
Scribbltaire.io is a game where a player guesses what is being drawn on the screen. A player can enter a game with a set of random doodles pulled from Google’s Quick Draw dataset where the objective is to correctly guess the subject of each doodle, simulating Skribbl.io without the need for friends or strangers. Skribbl.io provides a platform to play a drawing and guessing game, but requires friends and other people to play. This solitaire version, Scribbltaire.io,  will provide the drawings for guessing while absolving the social requirements of Skribbl.io. Scribbltaire.io provides entertainment through a similar venue to Skribbl.io, engaging players that seek expressive and social gameplay. 

This app is a single player game, targeted at lonely people of all ages. A player can enjoy this quick and simple game without the need for friends or interacting with strangers.

Scribbltaire.io has one main feature being the main game mode with subproblems such as displaying the doodle, providing feedback to players’ guesses, and tracking score. There may be variations on the main feature in the form of alternate game modes such as a timed mode where a player’s score is affected by the time it takes for them to guess the drawing. The app draws strength from the readily available source of doodles from Google’s Quick Draw dataset containing over 50 million doodles for 345 subjects to quickly generate doodles and enable a variety of game modes.

One possible game mode may present the player with three doodles, two of which share the same subject and the third differs and the player is asked to name the odd one out by subject. Another mode may present a set of ten doodles of the same subject at once and time the player on how fast (and accurate) they can name the shared subject over several sets.

Some sample stories for this application are: “as a player, I want to select a game mode that suits my playstyle.” and “as a player, I want to view my scores so that I can look at my progress and performance in the game.” Notably, the main users we’re considering for these stories are the players and most of the actions they perform will be centered around the game. Other actions such as using a menu to exit or restart a game are stories that fit into the epic of playing Scribbltaire.io.
