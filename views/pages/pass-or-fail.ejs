            Rules:<br>
            Each round, you will be presented with a picture along with the word that picture represents. <br>
            Click "Pass" if you believe that Google's Quick, Draw! ai was able to guess what the picture was. Click fail otherwise. <br>
            If you guess correctly, you'll be given a point!<br>
            There are 10 rounds in total so try you best to get a perfect score!
